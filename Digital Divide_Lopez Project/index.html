    <p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, children across the region of Latin America have lost nearly 4x more days of schooling compared to children from other regions of the world, according to a recent report by Unicef. Not all countries within the region, however, were impacted in the same way. This report will focus on two countries in Latin America, Brazil, which has the highest GDP in the region, and Bolivia, one of the poorest countries in the region, and the systems that these countries placed (or did not place) to ensure continued schooling for all students.
