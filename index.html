      <p> Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, students across the region of Latin America have lost nearly 4x more days of schooling compared to students from other regions of the world, according to a recent report by Unicef.</p>

      <h6>Not all countries within the region, however, were impacted in the same way.</h6>

      <p>Nations resorted to a variety of different learning methods. From listening along to radio transmissions and televised programming, to digital applications on computers and phones.</p>

      <p>This report will compare the various learning methods introduced to students in Brazil and Bolivia, two countries with strong disparties in connectivity and access to learning resources.

          <h5> The number of connected households in Brazil however, is not equal across the nation. The most economically marginalized communities are the least connected, such as the North and Northeast region, where 46.7% of households are without internet connection.

         <div class="stat2"> <h7>Brazil</h7> Many of the isolated indigenous communities in Brazil have resorted to radio programming to transmit news, regional information and educational programming. In the Alto do Rio Negro indigenous territory, 300 radio stations are distributed across municipalities.

          <h5> Radio education is often used in tandem with other applications to access worksheets and assignments. While a household may have access to a radio, not all households have a cell phone or tablet to complete assignments.

         <div class="stat2"> <h7>Brazil</h7> The most connected regions in Brazil rely heavily on wireless connection, even as 90% of households possess a television set. In indigenous communities, such as the states of Amazonas and Par√°, a strategic learning program via television transmission was established.

         <div class="stat2"> <h7> Brazil,</h7> on the other hand, was considered "established" when it came to providing alternative learning opportunities. Their lowest ranking was in virtual tutoring.
